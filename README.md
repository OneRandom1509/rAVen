Just making songs look cool

## Deps

clang (or any compiler really)
bash

## C libs used

raylib
math, complex, assert for FFT
Other standard libs

## UNDERSTANDING FFT

Fast Fourier Transform is very cool and blends both maths and algorithms pretty well

Check the comments in the [FFT](https://github.com/nots1dd/rAVen/blob/main/fft.c) C file

## Building

Using the build script:

```sh 
chmod +x build.sh 
./build.sh
./raven
```
