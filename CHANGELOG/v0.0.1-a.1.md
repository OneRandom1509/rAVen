# CHANGELOG FOR rAVen

## Version 0.0.1 in ALPHA

1. Added "libavformat" library to extract an audio file's metadata
2. Finally switched over N value from just 256 to 1<<13 [N is max freq range] to m (audible frequency bands) for a smoother and cleaner audio visualization
3. Added a new visualization mode "PIXEL" that is similar to "STANDARD" but just pixelated based on the step value 
4. Callback function change to use memmove and logic to better accommodate for better bufferData
5. Limited text for every metadata field in the track info win
6. Other misc changes

## Future

-> CMake build systems fix

-> Code cleanup

-> Possible conf file to customize color schema
